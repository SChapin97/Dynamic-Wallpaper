# Dynamic-Wallpaper

- This is a repository of inter-connected scripts (python and shell code) to dynamically change the desktop wallpaper on a KDE-based Linux system on a regular basis.
- The set of scripts pulls down landscape images from a number of pre-defined subreddits and will save them to a Wallpaper directory.
- Those images (and any already in the directory) will be randomly selected to be the desktop background on a timed basis.
